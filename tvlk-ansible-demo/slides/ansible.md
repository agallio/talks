local.yml

```yaml [3-5]
- hosts: localhost
  pre_tasks: ...
  tasks:
    - include: tasks/zsh.yml
    - include: tasks/node.yml
```

[task].yml

```yaml
# just give it a name and what task it should run
- name: Install vim
  apt: name=vim
```

```yaml [3-4]

  apt: name=vim
  tags:
    - install
```
